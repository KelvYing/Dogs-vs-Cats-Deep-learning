# Dogs-vs-Cats-Deep-learning
## Data: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=54765
## Model: 
- Pictures are processed through cv2 and into numpy arrays
- CNN model build using Tensorflow, containing conv2d and dense layers
- Reduced Overfitting using Batchnormalization and Dropout methods
- Final accuarcy of 0.8280 on verification set


## Purpose:
- Practice creating a CNN using Tensorflow
- Apply common practices to optimize model
- Utilize Cv2 and numpy arrays to fit to model
Deep learning project that create a binary classification model comparing pictures of dogs and cats.
